# Weather-API

## The purpose for this challenge is: 

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## To acomplish this I had to learn more about how server sided API's work as well as how to parse JSON data and properly display this data through DOM Manipulation.
